# keycloak-provision

Keycloak server provisioning and configuration utilities.

Mostly an encapsulation of `@keycloak/keycloak-admin-client` to collect implementation details in, ie. which npm dependencies and versions to use, so that doesn't have to be specified in every package that needs websockets.
