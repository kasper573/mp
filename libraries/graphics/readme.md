An encapsulation of [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/), but also additional general purpose but custom built pixi.js components and mechanisms.

Mostly an encapsulation package to collect implementation details in, ie. which npm dependencies and versions to use, so that doesn't have to be specified in every package that needs pixi.js.
