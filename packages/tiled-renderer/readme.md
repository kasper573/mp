# tiled-renderer

Tiled map renderer for game environments

This package renders Tiled map data using PixiJS graphics. It takes parsed map data from the tiled-loader package and creates visual representations with proper layering, tile positioning, and rendering optimizations. The renderer supports multiple tile layers, object layers, and various tile types commonly used in 2D games. It's optimized for performance in real-time game environments with support for large maps and efficient culling.
