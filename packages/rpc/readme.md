# rpc

Remote procedure call utilities for client-server communication

This package provides a type-safe RPC framework with support for binary serialization and React Query integration. It includes a builder pattern for creating RPC transceivers, proxy-based invokers for seamless method calls, and React hooks for making RPC calls with caching and state management. The system supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations with automatic serialization using the encoding package. It's designed to make client-server communication feel like local function calls while maintaining performance and type safety.
