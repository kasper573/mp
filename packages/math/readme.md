Mathematical utilities for vectors, matrices, and geometric operations

This package provides essential mathematical utilities for 2D graphics and game development. It includes vector operations (addition, subtraction, dot product, etc.), matrix transformations, geometric primitives (rectangles, polygons, polylines, ellipses), and utility functions like clamping. The Vector class supports both mathematical operations and coordinate transformations commonly needed in graphics programming. All utilities are designed to be lightweight and work well with game engines and graphics libraries.
