Standard utility functions and common helpers

This package contains fundamental utility functions used throughout the monorepo. It includes type-safe assertion functions, collection utilities, function composition helpers, random number generation, UUID creation, and branded types for additional type safety. The package also provides Result types for error handling patterns and short ID generation. These utilities serve as the foundation for other packages and help maintain consistency across the codebase.
