Authentication utilities for OpenID Connect and JWT handling

This package provides comprehensive authentication functionality for both client and server environments. It implements OpenID Connect flows using JWT tokens with role-based access control. The client module offers reactive state management for user identity and authentication status, while the server module provides JWT token verification with JWKS support. The package includes special bypass token functionality for development and testing scenarios, allowing developers to simulate authenticated users without requiring a full OAuth flow.
