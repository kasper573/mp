# graphics

Graphics utilities and components built on PixiJS

This package extends PixiJS with additional functionality for game development and React integration. It provides an animation controller for managing sprite animations, reactive collections that automatically sync with PixiJS container children, and custom filters like TintFilter for color manipulation. The React integration (`/react` export) includes a `useGraphics` hook that simplifies PixiJS application setup with automatic canvas management, responsive resizing, and proper cleanup. The package re-exports all PixiJS functionality while adding these convenience layers.
