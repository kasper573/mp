# path-finding

Pathfinding algorithms and utilities

This package provides A\* pathfinding algorithms built on ngraph for 2D vector-based navigation. It includes a VectorGraph class that manages spatial nodes and connections, supports dynamic node weighting for different terrains or conditions, and can find optimal paths between points. The implementation is optimized for game scenarios where entities need to navigate through complex environments while avoiding obstacles or preferring certain routes.
