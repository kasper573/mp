Game engine core components and systems

This package provides the fundamental building blocks for interactive game experiences. It includes a main Engine class that orchestrates camera controls, pointer/mouse input, keyboard input, and frame timing. The engine supports both interactive and non-interactive modes, manages viewport resizing, and provides spring-based animations for smooth motion. Key components include a Camera system for world-to-screen transformations, input handlers that work with the camera's coordinate system, and a frame emitter for consistent update loops. The engine is designed to be lightweight and framework-agnostic.
