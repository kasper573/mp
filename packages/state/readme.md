# state

State management utilities and reactive primitives

This package provides reactive state management built on Preact Signals with additional utilities for common patterns. It includes custom signal implementations, memory and universal storage adapters for persistence, and React integration hooks. The package extends the signals API with convenient abstractions while maintaining compatibility with Preact's reactive system. It's designed to handle both ephemeral application state and persistent data with automatic synchronization.
