# tiled-loader

A TypeScript Tiled map editor JSON parser

This package provides functionality to load and parse map files from the Tiled map editor. It supports various map formats including compressed data using pako for gzip decompression. The loader handles different layer types, tilesets, and object layers commonly used in 2D game development. It's designed to work seamlessly with the tiled-renderer package to display parsed map data in game environments.
