# keycloak-provision

Keycloak server provisioning and configuration utilities

This package provides utilities for automatically provisioning and configuring Keycloak authentication servers. It uses the Keycloak Admin Client to set up realms, clients, roles, and users programmatically. This is particularly useful for development environments and automated deployments where consistent authentication configuration needs to be established. The package abstracts the complexity of Keycloak's REST API into simple, reusable functions.
