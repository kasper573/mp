This application provides comprehensive end-to-end testing using Playwright. It tests the complete user flows from authentication through gameplay, ensuring all components work together correctly. The tests can run against both development and testing environments, simulating real user interactions with the web client and verifying server responses. It includes utilities for generating test data and handles the complexity of testing real-time multiplayer interactions.
