Core game logic and mechanics

This package contains the shared game logic that runs on both client and server. It includes entity management, game state synchronization, map rendering with Tiled integration, and game mechanics like movement and interactions. The package is designed to be environment-agnostic, allowing the same logic to run in browsers and Node.js. It provides the foundation for the multiplayer experience with consistent behavior across all clients and the authoritative server.
