# loadtest

Load testing utilities for server performance testing

See package.json scripts for how to run the load tests against various environments. Append `--help` to the scripts for more options.

## Heads up

When running the load test multiple times locally, remember to reset the db between runs to avoid test pollution. See the [db package](../../integrations/db) for how to reset the db.
