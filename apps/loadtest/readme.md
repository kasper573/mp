# loadtest

Load testing utilities for server performance testing

This application provides load testing capabilities to evaluate server performance under various load conditions. It simulates multiple concurrent clients connecting, authenticating, and participating in game sessions to identify performance bottlenecks and scalability limits. The load tests can target both development and testing environments, helping ensure the server can handle expected traffic loads while maintaining responsive gameplay.
