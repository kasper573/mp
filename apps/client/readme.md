# client

Web client application for the multiplayer game

This is the main client application built with Preact and Vite. It provides the user interface for the multiplayer game, including authentication, game lobbies, and real-time gameplay. The client communicates with the server through RPC calls and WebSocket connections for real-time synchronization. It uses the game package for shared logic, the engine for input handling, and various UI packages for components. The application supports hot reloading during development and optimized builds for production.
